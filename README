bassvamp.py
-----------

As a proud owner of a Behringer Bass V-Amp2 and, more than that, a Linux
enthusiast, I was forced to hack a couple of scripts to program the presets
on my unit without the burden of having to reboot my computer into another
operating system or boot a virtual machine.

Later on I thought about writing a GUI to the scripts, and chose python,
PyQt and QT4 as the tools for the job. I used QT Designer to create the
prototype interface used here.

The initial idea was to have an interface to load and store presets both
on the Bass V-Amp unit and on files (.syx). This is mostly done and the
interface reflects what was read from the unit or from file.

As this is just the first stab at the introductory text, I will make it
short and stop here. Hopefully soon I will describe all the features 
already implemented and list the TODO tasks.
